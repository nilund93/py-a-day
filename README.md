Repository for storing code written as part of a {Code}-a-day project.

## Goals

{Code}-a-day means you should aim to write a few lines of "runnable" code each day, with the goal of becoming more used to the language as well as with the practice of writing code on your free time.

If you want, replace {Code} with your language [abbreviation] of choice (e.g. `go-a-day`, `c-a-day`, `py-a-day`).

"Runnable", in this context, simply means the code written should be compilable, runnable and error-free. It doesn't necessarily need to be bug-free. In the case of small, atomic programs, the program itself needs to be runnable (possibly requiring some interaction as specified in an accompanying program comment), and in the case of larger programs spanning multiple days of coding, functions can be verifiably "runnable" by an accompanying unit test.

Programs should be commented as well as possible following any language-specific standard, if applicable.

Note: Larger chores such as adding or overhauling a workflow may count towards a streak. This is to promote focusing on completing quality-of-life improvements in the repo, as well as allowing you to sometimes count learning surrounding technologies towards the bigger goal of becoming a better developer.

## Structure

- Atomic programs are stored under `/atomic/{day}/{program-title}/`
- Larger programs are stored under `/projects/{project-title}/`
- Course-specific labs are stored under `/labs/{course-provider}/{lab-title}/`.

## Specific terms for atomic programs

In order to give yourself better conditions to maintain a streak and momentum, program are considered valid regardless of size or complexity - "Hello World, for example, would be a valid submission. However, the same program should not be allowed to be submitted multiple days. This is summarised as "only submit programs whose abstraction is (sufficiently) unique". In the case of "Hello World!", it can be abstracted into "A program that prints a hard-coded string to stdout.", which would bar other similarly abstracted programs. But, say, a program that echoes an input is fine (once).

Best of luck!
